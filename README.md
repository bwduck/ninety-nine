# Game Rules 
[Rules of 99.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-nine_(addition_card_game))

The rules in this version of 99 are slightly different than the default, as it was based off a family version of the game. The differences are as follows:
- A has a value of 1
- 8 swaps the direction of play
- 9 has a value of 0, or “holding”
- 10 has a value of -10
- King brings the score to 99

# Demo
Try out the [demo.](https://k-duck.github.io/ninety-nine/ )

Currently the program is incomplete.  At this stage one round can be played with the user controlling each player. The player that loses will lose a coin, but the game does not reset in this version of the program.
